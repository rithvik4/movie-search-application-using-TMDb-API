# Movie Search Application using The Movie Database (TMDb) API


1. Front-end:
   - Built an intuitive user interface where users can enter their movie search queries.
   - Fetches search results from the TMDb API using the appropriate endpoint and display them in an organized and visually appealing manner.
   - Displays relevant movie details such as title, release date, overview, and ratings for each search result.
   - Ensures the application is responsive and provides a smooth user experience across different devices and screen sizes.

2. Back-end:
   - Utilizes a server-side technology of your choice (e.g., NodeJS, Python, PHP) to handle API requests from the front-end.
   - Implements a server route or function that communicates with the TMDb API and returns the search results based on user queries.
   - Retrieves the necessary movie details from the TMDb API and send them back to the front-end.

3. Functionality:
   - Allows users to enter their movie search queries and trigger the search functionality.
   - Fetches the search results from the back-end and display them on the front-end.
   - Handles any errors or invalid search queries gracefully to provide a seamless user experience.

4. Additional Considerations:
   - Clean, well-structured code following best practices.
   - Implemented appropriate error handling for API requests and responses.
   - Considered pagination or infinite scrolling for displaying multiple search results.
   - Applied suitable styling and consider user experience design principles to enhance the visual appeal and usability of the application.
